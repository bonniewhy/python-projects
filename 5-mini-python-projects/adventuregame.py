# 4. TEXTBASED ADVENTURE GAME ---
#       TODO: Remember "Adventure"? Well, we're going to build a more basic version of that.
#       A complete text game, the program will let users move through rooms based on user
#       input and get descriptions of each room. To create this, you'll need to establish
#       the directions in which the user can move, a way to track how far the user has moved
#       (and therefore which room they are in), and to print out a description. You'll also
#       need to set limits for how far the user can move. In other words, create "walls" around
#       the rooms to tell the user, "You can't move further in this direction."
#
#       Concepts to keep in mind --
#           -- Strings
#           -- Variables
#           -- Input/Output
#           -- If/Else Statements
#           -- Print
#           -- List
#           -- Integers
#
#       The tricky parts here will involve setting up the directions and keeping track of just
#       how far the user has "walked" in the game. I suggest sticking to just a few basic
#       descriptions or rooms, perhaps 6 at most. This project also continues to build on using
#       user inputted data. It can be a relatively basic game, but if you want to build this
#       into a vast, complex world, the coding will get substantially harder, especially if you
#       want your user to start interacting with actual objects within the game. The complexity
#       could be great, if you'd like to make this into a long-term project. *Hint Hint*
